# Interpreter

Ruslan Spivak created an excellent series of blog posts showing how to build an interpreter. His blog posts used the python language. To help develop my Typescript skills I am recreating his code in Typescript. His explanations of the process is excellent and well worth reading. I will let the user refer to his blog posts for explaining the Interpreter.

## Part 1. Build a simple calculator

[Let's Build a Simple Interpreter. Part 1](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/)

Typescript learnings from part 1:

- how to create enums
- creating a custom error object
- make a variable with multiple types (number | string | null) work in all cases
- public and private variables and methods(functions)
- creating a simple repl loop
