## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently

- [Heap](/src/heap/)

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is
a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
