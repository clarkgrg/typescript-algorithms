# Typescript Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains Typescript based examples of many popular algorithms, data structures,
and design patterns.

I created this repository as a organized practice area.

This repository is based on the work of others, please visit the source for more complete descriptions and explanations:

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently

- [Heap](/src/heap/)

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is
a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.

- [FizzBuzz](/src/fizzbuzz/)
- [Anagram](/src/anagram/)
- [Palindrome](/src/palindrome/)
- [Simple sort](/src/simple-sort/)
- [bubbleSort](/src/bubbleSort/)
- [quickSort](/src/quickSort/)
- [insertionSort](/src/insertionSort)
- [mergeSort](/src/mergeSort)
- [binarySearch](/src/binarySearch)

## Design Patterns

## Typescript snippets

Interesting problems and functionality in Typescript/Javascript

- [async forEach, for, and map](/src/typebits)

## Interpreter

Can we build a Typescript version of the python interpreter built by the excellent blog posts from Ruslan Spivak.

- [Interpreter Part 1 - Simple Calculator](/src/interpreter)
- [Interpreter Part 2 - Enhanced Calculator](/src/interpreter)
- [Interpreter Part 3 - Enhanced Calculator any number of +, -](/src/interpreter)
- [Interpreter Part 4 - Enhanced Calculator with \*, / ](/src/interpreter)
- [Interpreter Part 5 - Calculator with \*, /, +, - and precedence](/src/interpreter)
- [Interpreter Part 6 - Calculator with (, ), \*, /, +, - and precedence](/src/interpreter)
- [Interpreter Part 7 - Calculator using Abstract Syntax Tree](/src/interpreter)
